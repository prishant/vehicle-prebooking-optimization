# vehicle-prebooking-optimization
– Worked on meta-heuristic techniques to automate the scheduling of pre-booked vehicle rides, for optimized total profits.
– Implemented a modified Genetic Algorithm to find the most optimal solution that outperforms other optimization approaches by achieving maximum profit with minimal time and iterations.
